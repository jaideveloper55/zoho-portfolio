# Zoho Web Developer Portfolio 

This repository contains my frontend portfolio using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript.

The goal of project is to demonstrate strong web fundamentals rather then visual effects of frameworks.

## Focus Areas 
- Semantic HTML structure
- Responsive layouts using Flexbox and grid
- Clean, readable CSS
- JavaScript fundamentls (DOM manipulation and events)
- Simple and maintainable code structure

## Why this approach
Zoho Web Developer interviews focus on practical HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills.
This portfolio is itentionally minimal to highlight clarity, structure, and understanding of core web concepts.

## Tech Stack 
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla Javascript

## How to run 
Open `index.html` directly in a browser.
No build tools or frameworks are required.
